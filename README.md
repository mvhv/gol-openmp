# gol-openmp

A short project completed as part of High Performance Computing (CITS3402) at the University of Western Australia. These implementations are a simplified 4-neighbourhood (Von Neumann) variant of the cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life.

Each C source file represents a slight variant on implementation for comparison of OpenMP performance. The provided Python scripts are a harness for confirming validity of the implementations and analysing their performance.

See the included report (provided as PDF and tex source) for more information.
